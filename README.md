# RestCountries

A simple iOS application, which presents data about various countries around the world. 
As a backend for the application, I'm using an openly available countries REST API - https://restcountries.eu.
The application UI and functionality is pretty simple, and consists of:
• Two views
• List of all countries with basic details on each such as: Name (English and local), national flag, population
• Details of a single country, with extended geographical and social introduction
• The application is adapted to properly run on various screen sizes and devices
• Unit tests for complex logic

I chose the MVVM architecture.
